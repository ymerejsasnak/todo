To Do List (easy JS practice) :)


plan:
no libraries!

save it using localstorage (have naming option to save/load multiple lists and clear list too)
STARTED WORK ON SAVING BUT NEEDS MORE

anything else to add to make it a bit more interesting?
-maybe an optional description for each item that appears/disappears when user clicks on item or something like that?
-click something to change 'priority' color on items?
-add little up/down (^ v) buttons to move items?
