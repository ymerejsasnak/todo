To Do List (easy JS practice) :)


plan:
no libraries!
user can type items which get added to list on left
user can click on item on left to send it to 'completed' list on right 
clicking on item in done list deletes it
save it using localstorage (have naming option to save/load multiple lists and clear list too)

anything else to add to make it a bit more interesting?
-maybe an optional description for each item that appears/disappears when user clicks on item or something like that?
