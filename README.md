# todo
To Do List (easy JS practice) :)


plan:
no libraries!

make saving/loading better
-have it do various checks when saving/loading
-have it prefix savename with something (todo-list or whatev)
-have a hidden div appear (or drop down list maybe??) with a list of lists to load rather than typing in by memory
-maybe even have option to combine lists (ie append one list to another...easy)

anything else to add to make it a bit more interesting?
-maybe an optional description for each item that appears/disappears when user clicks on item or something like that?
-click something to change 'priority' color on items?
-add little up/down (^ v) buttons to move items?
