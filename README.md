To Do List (easy JS practice) :)


plan:
no libraries!

make saving/loading better
-have it do various checks when saving/loading
-maybe even have option to combine lists (ie append one list to another...easy)

anything else to add to make it a bit more interesting?
-maybe an optional description for each item that appears/disappears when user clicks on item or something like that?
-add little up/down (^ v) buttons to move items?
